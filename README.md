# Football Data Analysis & Visualization

<p>This is my first try at Data Analysis and Visualization. The Data is taken from Kaggle. 
Along with the analysis we will also visualize the data using different graphs.
The questions which we will look into are:</p>

<p>Pandas are used for analysis of Data and for visualization, matplotlib and seaborn is used. Different graphs like barplot, scatterplot, lineplot, jointplot, regplot are used to visualize the data.</p>
